## ‚öôÔ∏è Script to Create the GitHub App

This script uses `curl`. Replace `MANIFEST_CODE` with the code GitHub gives you after starting the "Create from Manifest" flow.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/app-manifests/MANIFEST_CODE/conversions \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @manifest.json
```

---

## ‚úÖ How to Get `MANIFEST_CODE`

1. Go to [Create a GitHub App from Manifest](https://github.com/settings/apps/new?manifest=true)
2. Paste your `manifest.json` content into the prompt.
3. GitHub will redirect you with a URL like: `?code=MANIFEST_CODE`
4. Plug that code into the `curl` script above.

---

## üéØ GitHub Will Respond With:

- `app_id`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `pem` (private key)

Use these in your `.env` or server configuration to finalize the app integration.
